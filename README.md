# api-testing
This is your API testing technical challenge.
The API under test is a public test API and is documented here: https://reqres.in/

Your task is to improve this API solution in any way you see fit, but the following requirements are mandatory:

1. Extract any environment specific variable to a JSON configuration file so that the solution can be run in a testing pipeline with multiple environments.
2. Refactor the feature file so that it conforms to BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) guidelines.
3. Refactor the Steps file in any way you see fit.
4. Implement the validation part of the test (Then).
5. Add more scenarios in order to cover at least two more endpoints. We would appreciate to cover the positive and negative flows.

Keep in mind:
- You can create, modify or delete as many solution files as you see fit.
- You can use any Nuget package with a public license.
- Your answer will be submitted as a Pull Request.

Have fun! :)
